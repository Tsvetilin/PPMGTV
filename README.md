Fully functional ASP.NET application using various technologies.
- video management
- gallery management
- notifications system
- CMS capabilities



## Note before download and usage
- The project relies on external service providers. Thus accessing them via their API requires authentication. An API Key need to be supplied in order to achive the full functional capacity of the app. Please fill in the required sections in the **appsettings.json** with your personal keys. The connection string for the databases are also required.
- An admin account is seeded with login credentials `mail@email.bg` for email and `Pass` for password.

## Summary
Despite providing SEO optimization, external login providers and much more, the website is far from being perfect. A lot regarding the UI/UX may be improved. The overall performance needs refinement. The project served its purpose well enought for the 4 years of its lifetime and satisfied the needs it was designed for. The end of the life of the platform is due to the lack of interest of the school staff for continuing the School TV legacy.
